Had a tough time figuring out which libraries Andy was using for his examples, so I had to sort out a million dependencies and read the docs.
Was able to get a very basic movement model with WASD, basically the same as Andy's.  Did not get a chance to look into implementing any shaders.
Future improvements would be to add better movement and look into working on shaders.
